# PhaseChange
Phase-change modeling based on a novel conservative phase-field method
Stefan problem for two different phase-field interface-capturing equations; the conservative Allen-Cahn equation and the Cahn-Hilliard equation.

This code can be used to generate Figure 2 of the research article "Phase-change modeling based on a novel conservative phase-field method".
